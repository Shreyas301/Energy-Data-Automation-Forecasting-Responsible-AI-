📊 Energy Demand Forecasting Results
Forecast vs Actual Energy Demand

The figure below compares actual energy demand with AI-generated forecasted demand over the evaluation period.

🔍 Interpretation

Actual Demand (dark blue) shows real observed energy consumption.

Forecasted Demand (light blue) represents model predictions generated using machine learning–based time-series forecasting.

The forecast closely aligns with real demand trends, capturing:

Daily and weekly seasonality

Demand volatility

Peak and off-peak consumption patterns

This visual overlap indicates strong short-term predictive capability.

🔢 Forecasted Output Values (Sample)

The forecasting model generates continuous energy demand values in megawatts (MW). Below is a representative sample of predicted outputs:

Timestamp	Actual Demand (MW)	Forecasted Demand (MW)
2025-12-01 00:00	1012	1005
2025-12-01 06:00	1189	1178
2025-12-01 12:00	1254	1261
2025-12-01 18:00	1120	1109
2025-12-02 00:00	980	992

✔ Forecasted values remain within a realistic operational range
✔ Peaks and troughs are preserved
✔ No abrupt or unstable predictions observed

📐 Model Performance Metric

The model was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 16.11 MW

Interpretation:

Predictions deviate by ~16 MW on average from actual demand.

Given the demand range of 700–1300 MW, this represents a low relative error.

MAE was selected due to its clarity and industry relevance in energy forecasting.

✅ Conclusion

The forecasting system produces numerically stable and operationally realistic demand values, with strong alignment between predicted and actual energy usage. These results validate the effectiveness of the AI-driven forecasting pipeline for applications such as energy planning, load balancing, and smart grid analytics.
